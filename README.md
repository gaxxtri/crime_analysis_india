# India Crime Policy Intelligence Dashboard

An interactive, data-driven dashboard analysing state-wise crime patterns in India
using statistical analysis, geospatial visualisation, and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Analyse spatial and temporal crime patterns across Indian states
- Evaluate justice system performance using key indicators
- Identify structural crime typologies using unsupervised machine learning
- Translate data insights into policy-relevant interpretations

## Data Sources
- National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB): Crime Statistics (2020–2022)
- Census of India 2011: Socio-demographic indicators

## Key Features
- Interactive crime maps (IPC rate, murder rate, chargesheeting efficiency)
- Analytical charts for crime trends and socio-demographic relationships
- Machine learning insights using PCA and clustering
- Policy interpretation and data-informed recommendations

## Machine Learning Approach
- Unsupervised learning (PCA, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Models used for pattern discovery and structural analysis
- No predictive or forecasting models employed

## Limitations
- Reliance on officially reported crime data
- Census indicators may not reflect recent demographic changes
- Analysis conducted at state level, not district level

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, GeoPandas)
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Leaflet.js, Chart.js
